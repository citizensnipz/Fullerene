## Decisions

## 2026-04-25 - SQLite is the canonical Fullerene memory store

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** Memory v0 needed persistent, inspectable storage without loading one giant text file, and without introducing embeddings, vector infrastructure, or model-based summarization.
- **Decision:** Store canonical memory records in SQLite under the local state directory. Treat SQLite rows as source of truth for episodic and semantic memory data, with working memory derived from bounded recent retrieval. Any future embeddings, vector search, or compressed machine representations are retrieval indexes or caches, not the authoritative memory store.
- **Consequences:** Memory stays deterministic, queryable, and testable in v0. Future retrieval layers can be added without changing what counts as remembered data, but richer indexing and schema evolution will need migration discipline.

## 2026-04-25 - Nexus v0 is a small dataclass-based runtime with explicit local persistence

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** Fullerene needed its first real runtime slice without provider coupling, database setup, or autonomous side effects.
- **Decision:** Implement the central loop as `Nexus` / `NexusRuntime` with stdlib dataclasses for events, facet results, decisions, records, and state. Use a pluggable state store with in-memory and file-backed JSON/JSONL implementations under an explicit local state directory.
- **Consequences:** The runtime is easy to test and inspect, but intentionally simple. SQLite, model backends, and real action execution stay out of scope until later slices need them.

## Suggested future entries

- SQLite migration strategy
- Model-port abstraction if provider integration is added
- Event shape changes between Nexus and richer facets
